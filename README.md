# Automatic Job Application Tracker and Organizer
Used for google sheets. When applying for jobs specifically on linked in, it grabs the job title, company name, and url and puts it into the google sheet for easier tracking and management of applied jobs.

Problem:

Tldr: Tracking job applications is tedious, i aim to fix that.

Some people can find a job they like after only 10's of applications. in that case going through the hassle of setting up and running this code is not the best for those people. For people like me who has to apply for hundreds maybe thousands of jobs, this program will make your job tracking and staying organized a breeze. Although this program can not fill in applications and turn them in for you, once you find a job you like and want to apply too, coming back to the program and with a press of the enter key, will automatically log the important details of the job you applied to. currently it logs the : DETAILS.
